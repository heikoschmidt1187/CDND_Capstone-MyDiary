# Capstone Project: My Diary

This is the implementation of a serverless cloud application for Udacity's Cloud Developer Nanodegree program capstone project. The application provides a personal online diary users can login and write a diary each day. Also the ability to upload a file for the day is given so the users can e.g. provide an image that fits to the user's mood at that day.

# Functionality of the application

The application allows to create, remove, update and get diary entries from a database and show them with a local running React based frontend. Users only have access to the items he/she has created.

# Diary entry

The application stores the diary entries, where each entry may contain the following fields:

* `entryid` (string) - a unique id for an diary entry
* `createdAt` (string) - date and time the diary entry was created
* `title` (string) (optional) - a title for the diary entry, e.g. to summary the mood on that day
* `content` (string) - the text content of the entry
* `attachmentUrl` (string) (optional) - a URL pointing to an image attached to the diary entry
